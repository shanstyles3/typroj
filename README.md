# typroj
Online pet shelter built on HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Bootstrap, JQuery

To run this project you will require XAMPP Server. Make sure that Apache and MySQL are running.

Open XAMPP control panel and click on the **'admin'** button next to MySQL. It will open to phpmyadmin on the browser. Since this project requires a database, you'll need to import the database which is available in the **'database'** folder. To do this:
1. Create a database **'pawprints'**(Please do not keep any other name).
2. Select on the **'import'** tab.
3. Select the file that contains the database. This is available in the **'database'** folder under **'pawprints.sql'**.

Once that is done, make sure that this project folder is saved in the directory where your xampp folder is saved and place it in **'xampp/htdocs'** folder.

Open your browser (preferably Google Chrome) and in the URL section enter **'localhost/pawprints/indexnew.php'**. This will open up to the homepage :) 

If you encounter any problems, please leave a comment.
